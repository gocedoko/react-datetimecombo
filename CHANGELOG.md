Changelog
=========

## 0.1.7
- Fix onChange callback when a day is clicked

## 0.1.4
- Add calendar icon in the input box.
- Add image loader in webpack, so that the datetime.png icon can be loaded from the css in the example.

## 0.1.3
- Add properties **fireCallbackOnYearChange** and **fireCallbackOnMonthChange**. When one is set to true, the onChange callback is fired when a year or a month has changed. Otherwise the callback is fired only when the day and/or the time has changed.

## 0.1.0
This is the first commit but the code is fully functional. Further refinements of the interface and the documentation are on the way.
